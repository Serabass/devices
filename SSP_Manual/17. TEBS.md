# TEBS

TEBS or Tamper Evident Bag System is a version of the NV200 banknote validator with a special cashbox
attachedment which operates as device to store bank notes into a special bag which will then be sealed when
the cashbox is extracted.

Each of the bags has a unique barcode which is registered by the TEBS system enableing the host system to
register cash amounts in each bag.

## Protocol versions less than 6:

|Data|byte offset|size (bytes)|notes|
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| Unit type | 0 | 1 | 0x0D = TEBS, 0x0E = TEBS with SMART Payout, 0x0F = TEBS with SMART Ticket |
| Firmware version | 1 | 4 | ASCII data of device firmware version (e.g. '0110' = 1.10) |
| Country code | 5 | 3 | ASCII code of the device dataset (e.g. 'EUR') |
| Value Multiplier | 8  | 3 | 3 The value to multiply the individual channels by to get the full value. If this value is 0 then it indicates that this is a protocol version 6 or greater compatible dataset where the values are given in the expanded segment of the return data. |
| Number of channels | 11 | 1 | The highest channel used in this device dataset [n] (1­16) |
| Channel Values | 12 | n | A variable size array of byes, 1 for each channel with a value from 1 to 255 which when multiplied by the value multiplier gives the full value of the note. If the value multiplier is zero then these values are zero. |
| Channel Security | 12 + n | n | An obsolete value showing security level. This is set to 2 if the value multiplier is > 0 otherwise 0. |
| Real value Multiplier | 12 +( n * 2) | 3 | The value by which the channel values can be multiplied to show their full value e.g. 5.00 EUR = 500 EUR cents |
| Protocol version | 15 + (n * 2) | 1 | The current protocol version set for this device |

| Protocol version | 15 + (n * 2) | 1 | The current protocol version set for this device |
| Expanded channel country code | 16 + (n * 2) | n * 3 | Three byte ascii code for each channel. This allows multi currency datasets to be used on SSP devices. These bytes are given only on protocol versions >= 6. |
| Expanded channel value | 16 + (n * 5) | n * 4 | 4 bytes for each channel value. These bytes are given only on protocol versions >= 6. |
