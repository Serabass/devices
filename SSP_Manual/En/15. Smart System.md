# Smart System

The Smart System device is a multi­coin pay­in, pay­out system with detachable fast coin pay­in feeder.

Coins fed into the pay­in head will be validated and counted and recognised coins are routed to the attached
hopper while rejected coins are fed out of the front of the system.

Coin hopper levels are adjusted internally.

The system can function as a stand­alone hopper payout system if the pay­in feeder head is removed.

**The SMART Systemhas a default SSP Address of 16 dec 0x10 hex**

|Data|byte offset|size (bytes)|notes|
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| Unit type | 0 1 | 3 | = SMART Hopper |
| Firmware version | 1 | 4 | ASCII data of device firmware version (e.g. '0110' = 1.10) |

| Protocol Version | 8 | 1 | The current protocol version set for this device |
| Number of coin values | 9 | 1 | The number of coin denominations in this device dataset. [n] |
| Coin values | 10 | n * 2 | 2  byte each value for the coin denominations (e.g. 0.05 coin = 0x05,0x00) |
