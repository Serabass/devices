## Description
ITL SSP devices use a system of protocol levels to control the event responses to polls to
ensure that changes would not affect systems with finite state machines unable to test for
new events with nonÂ­defined data lengths.

Use this command to allow the host to set which protocol version to operate the slave
device.

If the device supports the requested protocol **OK** **(0xF0)** will be returned.
If not then **FAIL** **(0xF8)** will be returned
# Packet examples
