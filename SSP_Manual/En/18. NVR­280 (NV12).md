known as an NV12. This devices allows the printing of tickets with will exit through the NV9's note path and
out of it's bezel. It also allows the NV9 to read barcodes on these printed tickets.

A range of SSP commands may be implemented to configure, modify and maintain print designs from the
host on­the­fly or by pre­configured templates.

The NVR­280 device is addressed seperately from the NV9, the NV9 setup request command will return 0x08

respond with the same printing (0xA5) and printed (0xA6) poll responses as the printer.
