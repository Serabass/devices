# Encryption Layer

## PACKET FORMAT

Encryption is mandatory for all payout devices and optional for pay in devices. Encrypted data and commands
are transported between the host and the slave(s) using the transport mechanism described above, the
encrypted information is stored in the data field in the format shown below:

|               |               |               |               |               |               |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| STX           | SEQ/SLAVE ID  | LENGTH        | DATA          | CRCL          | CRCH          |

|               |              |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| STEX          | Single byte indicating the start of an encrypted data block ­ 0x7E                                                                                                                                    |
| eLENGTH       | The length of the data included in the packet ­ this does not include STEX, COUNT, the packing or the CRC                                                                                             |
| eCOUNT        | A four byte unsigned integer. This is a sequence count of encrypted packets, it isincremented each time a packet is encrypted and sent, and each time an encrypted packet is received and decrypted.  |
| eDATA         | Commands or data to be transferred                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ePACKING      | Random data to make the length of the length +count + data + packing + CRCL + CRCH to be a multiple of 16 bytes                                                                                       |
| eCRCL/eCRCH   | Low and high byte of a forward CRC­16 algorithm using the polynomial (X16 + X15 + X2 +1) calculated on all bytes except STEX. It is initialised using the seed 0xFFFF                                 |


After power up and reset the slave will stay disabled and will respond to all commands with the generic
response KEY_NOT_SET (0xFA), without executing the command, until the key has been negotiated. There
are two classes of command and response, general commands and commands involved in credit transfer.

General commands may be sent with or without using the encryption layer. The slave will reply using the
same method, unless the response contains credit information, in this case the reply will always be encrypted.

Credit transfer commands, a hopper payout for example, will only be accepted by the slave if received encrypted.
Commands that must be encrypted on an encryption­enabled product are indicated on the command
descriptions for each command. The STEX byte is used to determine the packet type. Ideally all
communications will be encrypted.

After the data has been decrypted the CRC algorithm is performed on all bytes including the CRC. The result
of this calculation will be zero if the data has been decrypted with the correct key. If the result of this
calculation is non­zero then the peripheral should assume that the host did not encrypt the data (transmission
errors are detected by the transport layer). The slave should go out of service until it is
reset.

The packets are sequenced using the sequence count; this is reset to 0 after a power cycle and each time the
encryption keys are successfully negotiated. The count is incremented by the host and slave each time they
successfully encrypt and transmit a
packet. After a packet is successfully decrypted the COUNT in the packet should be compared with the
internal COUNT, if they do not match then the packet is discarded.
