# SMART Hopper

SMART Hopper is a coin payout device capable of discriminating and paying out multi­denominations of
stored coins from its internal storage hopper.

Coins added to the hopper can be designated to be routed to an external cashbox on detection or recycled and
stored in the hopper unit to be available for a requested payout.

SMART Hopper also supports the addition of a connected cctalk™ or eSSP™ coin mechanism which will
automatically add its validated coins to the SMART Hopper system levels.

Note that payout values are in terms of the of the penny value of that currency. So for 5.00, the value sent
and returned by the hopper would be 500. All transactions with a SMART hopper must be encrypted to
prevent dispense commands being recorded and replayed by an external device.

Addressing

**The SMART Hopper has a default SSP Address of 16 dec 0x10 hex.**

## Protocol version less than 6:

|Data|byte offset|size (bytes)|notes|
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| Unit type | 0 | 1 | 3 = SMART Hopper |
| Firmware version | 1 | 4 | ASCII data of device firmware version (e.g. '0110' = 1.10) |
| Country code | 5 | 3 | ASCII code of the device dataset (e.g. 'EUR') |
| Protocol Version | 8 | 1 | The current protocol version set for this device |
| Number of coin values | 9 | 1 | The number of coin denominations in this device dataset. [n] |
| Coin values | 10 | n * 2 | 2 byte each value for the coin denominations (e.g. 0.05 coin = 0x05,0x00) |
