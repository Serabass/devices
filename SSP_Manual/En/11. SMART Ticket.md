# SMART Ticket

The SMART Ticket device is an add on unit to the NV200 to enable printing and payout via the NV200 bezel of
paper tickets of configurabale designs. A range of SSP commands may be implemented to configure, modify
and maintain print designs from the host on­the­fly or by pre­configured templates.
The SMART Ticket device is addressed seperately from the NV200, the NV200 setup request command will
return 0x08 for the Uint type if a SMART Ticket device is attached.

When communicating with the NV200 attached to the printer, optional additional poll events may be enabled.
These are enabled by sending an SSP packet with the command header 0x72 to the NV200. Polls will the
respond with the same printing (0xA5) and printed (0xA6) poll responses as the printer.

**The SMART Ticket has a default SSP Address of 64 dec 0x40 hex**
