# Encryption Keys

The encryption key length is 128 bits. However this is divided into two parts. The lower 64 bits are fixed and
specified by the machine manufacturer, this allows the manufacturer control which devices are used in their machines.

The higher 64 bits are securely negotiated by the slave and host at power up, this ensures each machine and
each session are using different keys. The key is negotiated by the Diffie­Hellman key exchange method.
See: [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie­Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange)

The exchange method is summarised in the table below. C code for the exchange algorithm is available from
ITL.

| Step | Host | Slave |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
| 1 | Generate prime number GENERATOR | |
| 2 | Use command Set Generator to send to slave Check GENERATOR is prime and store | Check GENERATOR is prime and store |
| 3 | Generate prime number MODULUS| 
| 4 | Use command Set Modulus to send to slave Check MODULUS is prime and store | Check MODULUS is prime and store |
| 5 | Generate Random Number HOST_RND | |
| 6 | Calculate HostInterKey: = GENERATOR ^ HOST_RND mod MODULUS | |
| 7 | Use command Request Key Exchange to send to slave. | Generate Random Number SLAVE_RND |
| 8 | | Calculate SlaveInterKey: = GENERATOR ^ SLAVE_RND mod MODULUS
| 9 | | Send to host as reply to Request Key Exchange |
| 10| Calculate Key: = SlaveInterKey ^ HOST_RND mod MODULUS | Calculate Key: = HostInterKey ^ SLAVE_RND mod MODULUS |

Note: ^ represents to the power of
