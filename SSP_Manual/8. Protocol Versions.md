An SSP Poll !!!(link)!!! command returns a list of events and data that have occurred in the device since the last poll.

The host machine then reads this event list taking note of the data length (if any) of each event.

On order to introduce new events, SSP uses a system of Protocol Version levels to identify the event types
and sizes a machine can expect to see in reponse to a poll. If this were not done, new unknown events with
unknown datasize to a machine not set­up for these would cause the event reading to fail.

A host system should take note of the protocol version of the device connected and ensure that it is not set
for a higer version that the one it is expecting to use.

The host can also check that the device can also be set to the higher protocol level, enusring that expected
events will be seen.

The listed events in this manual show the protocol version level of each event.
As part of the start­up procedure, the host should read the current protocol level of the device (using the setup request !!!(LINK)!!! command).
