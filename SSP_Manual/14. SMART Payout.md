# SMART Payout

The Smart Payout is an extension of a banknote validator, all commands are sent to the validator using its
address (0x00). Information on the types of note that can be handled is obtained from the standard note
validator commands.

Note that payout values are in terms of the penny value of that currency. So for 5.00, the value sent and
returned by the payout would be 500.

The host simply has to tell the unit the value it wishes to dispense. The unit will manage which notes are
stored to be used for payout and their location to minimise the payout time, and which notes, of the type
enable for storage, are sent to the stacker. This is the recommended mode of operation.

**The SMART Payout has a default SSP Address of 0.**

## Protocol versions less than 6:

|Data|byte offset|size (bytes)|notes|
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| Unit type | 0 | 1 | 0x06 = SMART Payout |
| Firmware version | 1 | 4 | ASCII data of device firmware version (e.g. '0110' = 1.10) |
| Country code | 5 | 3 | ASCII code of the device dataset (e.g. 'EUR') |
| Value Multiplier | 8 | 3| 3 The value to multiply the individual channels by to get the full value. If this value is 0 then it indicates that this is a protocol version 6 or greater compatible dataset where the values are given in the expanded segment of the return data. |
| Number of channels | 11 | 1 | The highest channel used in this device dataset [n] (1­16) |
| Channel Values | 12 | n | A variable size array of byes, 1 for each channel with a value from 1 to 255 which when multiplied by the value multiplier gives the full value of the note. If the value multiplier is zero then these values are zero. |
| Channel Security | 12 + n | n | An obsolete value showing security level. This is set to 2 if the value multiplier is > 0 otherwise 0. |
| Real value Multiplier | 12 +( n * 2) | 3 | The value by which the channel values can be multiplied to show their full value e.g. 5.00 EUR = 500 EUR cents |
| Protocol version | 15 + (n * 2) | 1 | The current protocol version set for this device |

## Protocol versions greater than or equal to 6:

| Protocol version | 15 + (n * 2) | 1 | The current protocol version set for this device |
| Expanded channel country code | 16 + (n * 2) n * | 3 | Three byte ascii code for each channel. This allows multi currency datasets to be used on SSP devices. These bytes are given only on protocol versions >= 6. |
| Expanded channel value | 16 + (n * 5) | n * 4 | 4 bytes for each channel value. These bytes are given only on protocol versions >= 6. |
