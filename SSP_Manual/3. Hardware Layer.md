Communication is by character transmission based on standard 8­bit asynchronous data transfer.

Only four wires are required TxD, RxD, +V and ground. The transmit line of the host is open collector, the receive line of each peripheral has a 10Kohm pull­up to 5 volts.The transmit output of each slave is open collector, the receive input of the host has a single 3k3 ohm pull­up to 5 volts.
The data format is as follows:

|               |               |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Encoding      | NRZ           |
| Baud Rate     | 9600          |
| Duplex        | Full          |
| Start bits    | 1             |
| Data Bits     | 8             |
| Parity        | none          |
| Stop bits     | 2             |

**Caution: Power to peripheral devices would normally be via the serial bus. However devices that
require a high current supply in excess of 1.5 Amps, e.g. hoppers, would be expected to be
supplied via a separate connector.**
