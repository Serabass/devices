# Components

## Frame Format 

This defines interface standard between HOST and LCDM-1000. 

### The basic DATA FORMAT is like below. 

#### Command Protocol 

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| EOT | ID | STX | CMD | DATA | ETX | BCC |

#### Response Protocol 

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SOH | ID | STX | CMD | DATA | ETX | BCC |

* BCC of command protocol is determined by “XOR” for the values from EOT to ETX. 
* BCC of response protocol is determined by “XOR” for the values from SOH to ETX. 
* Assignment of Value

|     |      | |     |      |
|-----|------|-|-----|------|
| SOH | 0X01 | | STX | 0X02 |
| ETX | 0X02 | | EOT | 0X04 |
| ACK | 0X06 | | NCK | 0X15 |
| ID  | 50   | |     |      |


## Definition of Interface between HOST and LCDM-1000
This defines interface standard between HOST and LCDM-1000. 

### Basic communication is performed like below

### Troubling in HOST COMMAND

The data of HOST COMMAND could be damaged by communication error
or BCC ERROR could happen.

### Troubling in RESPONSE COMMAND

[IMAGE]

NCK could be sent even 3 times for the RESPONSE, but in this case, the
transaction would stop and LCDM would send no more RSP. When there is no
response, RSP would be also sent 3 times until TIMEOUT. 

## Definition of Timings 

Each FRAME defines Timings as below. 

###  TIMEOUT in basic communication FRAME 

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| EOT or SOH | ID | STX | CMD | DATA | ETX | BCC |
{{ 200ms }} 

The TIMEOUT in communication FRAME is defined the duration from EOT/STX to
BCC 

### Response Timings to basic communication FRAME 

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| EOT or SOH | ID | STX | CMD | DATA | ETX | BCC |
{{ 200ms }} 

|   |
|---|
| ACK |
{{ 500ms }} 

###  Response TIMEOUT to COMMAND

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| EOT | ID | STX | CMD | DATA | ETX | BCC |
{{ 200ms }}

## COMMAND FORMAT
The COMMAND(or CMD) is the data frame from HOST to LCDM-1000. 

|                                       |
|---------------------------------------|
| EOT                                   |

| STX                                   |
| COMMAND                               |
| 10’s of the requested bills (ASCII)   |
| 1,s of the requested bills (ASCII)    |
| ETX                                   |
| BCC                                   |
